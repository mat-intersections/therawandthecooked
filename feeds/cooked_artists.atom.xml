Artist and designer of sounding instruments, Andrea composed and produced electronic music with Orax and Too Young To Love (signed to EMI Publishing and released by different labels between 2009 and 2011). A short list of the festival where he performed includes: Isle of Wight Festival 2011 (Strongbow Tent), Exit Festival 2010, and many UK festivals like Kendal Calling and Offset Festival. After seven years of silence, An Alien emerged from an hacked server full of political memes and travelled via a cloud to the UK.

He created the enormously popular Turing Machine, Mikrophonie and Radio Music modules for Eurorack Synthesiser, which are open-source designs inspired by early experimental electronic music. He's a former journalist and magazine editor who taught himself electronics after attending a workshop by Tom Bugs on Brick Lane.
