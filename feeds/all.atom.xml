The Bela team guide you through the process of using their lightning fast single board computer to make low latency interactive prototypes, and GMSN! will be on site to supervise the construction of one of their newest eurorack modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will also be trade stands from some of the UK’s leading modular outlets, and modular systems to learn and experiment on and keynote presentations from experts in the instrument and modular world.&lt;/p&gt;

For those yet to make its acquaintance, Live Coding is the creation of sonic or visual content generated through the execution of computer code in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The daytime part of the event features workshops hosted by experienced live coders, where newcomers will be guided through the processes in a practical environment, leading to an effective working knowledge of the practice. Experienced users will be able to build on existing skills, branch out into new applications and develop a greater understanding of the craft guided by lightning presentations from experienced performers.&lt;/p&gt;

His aesthetically and geographically restless lifestyle has enabled him to traverse a diverse range of musical worlds including DJ-ing electronic dance music, live electronic jam sessions, electroacoustic composition, free improvisation and audiovisual performances. He has forged collaborations with a number of curious and innovative musicians, writers and visual artists along the way focussed on exploring links between technology, creativity and tradition. In recent years he has been actively participating in the Algorave movement developing a style he describes as noisefunk which combines traditional rhythm patterns with evolutionary synthesis algorithms. Currently, Alo works as a researcher and a lecturer in music technology in London, while continuing to perform his music and visuals to audiences worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>AN ALIEN</title><link href="https://therawandthecooked.intersections.io/an-alien.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2000-01-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tom Gurion</name></author><id>tag:therawandthecooked.intersections.io,2000-01-01:/an-alien.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;An Alien is the brand new music project of Andrea Guidi.
