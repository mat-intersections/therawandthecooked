&lt;p&gt;Tom Whitwell designs DIY musical instruments as Music Thing Modular. He created the enormously popular Turing Machine, Mikrophonie and Radio Music modules for Eurorack Synthesiser, which are open-source designs inspired by early experimental electronic music. He's a former journalist and magazine editor who taught himself electronics after attending a workshop by Tom Bugs on Brick Lane. In his talk, Tom tells the story of how he got started designing his first module, from experimentation and prototyping to design and (distributed) mass production.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>QMUL Talk - Giacomo Lepri</title><link href="https://therawandthecooked.intersections.io/talk_giacomo_lepri.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-09-29T15:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-29T15:30:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tom Gurion</name></author><id>tag:therawandthecooked.intersections.io,2018-09-29:/talk_giacomo_lepri.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cembalo Scrivano - an interactive audiovisual installation.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Cembalo Scrivano - an interactive audiovisual installation.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>QMUL Talk - Lia Mice</title><link href="https://therawandthecooked.intersections.io/talk_lia_mice.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-09-29T15:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-29T15:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tom Gurion</name></author><id>tag:therawandthecooked.intersections.io,2018-09-29:/talk_lia_mice.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Producer, DJ, and instrument designer Lia Mice discusses drawing inspiration from science-fiction to explore how the sampler is a time machine - interacting with the past, present and future, and the experiments that are the foundation of her upcoming LP The Sampler As A Time Machine, out November 9 on Optimo …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Producer, DJ, and instrument designer Lia Mice discusses drawing inspiration from science-fiction to explore how the sampler is a time machine - interacting with the past, present and future, and the experiments that are the foundation of her upcoming LP The Sampler As A Time Machine, out November 9 on Optimo Music.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Break</title><link href="https://therawandthecooked.intersections.io/break.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-09-29T14:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-29T14:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tom Gurion</name></author><id>tag:therawandthecooked.intersections.io,2018-09-29:/break.html</id><summary type="html"></summary><content type="html"></content></entry><entry><title>Bela</title><link href="https://therawandthecooked.intersections.io/workshop_bela.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-09-29T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-09-29T12:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tom Gurion</name></author><id>tag:therawandthecooked.intersections.io,2018-09-29:/workshop_bela.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://bela.io/"&gt;bela&lt;/a&gt; team show you how to make an ultra low latency Digital Musial Instrument.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This hands-on workshop introduces &lt;a href="http://bela.io"&gt;Bela&lt;/a&gt;, an embedded maker platform for responsive audio and sensor processing.
