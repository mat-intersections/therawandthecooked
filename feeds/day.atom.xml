The Bela team guide you through the process of using their lightning fast single board computer to make low latency interactive prototypes, and GMSN! will be on site to supervise the construction of one of their newest eurorack modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will also be trade stands from some of the UKâ€™s leading modular outlets, and modular systems to learn and experiment on and keynote presentations from experts in the instrument and modular world.&lt;/p&gt;

For those yet to make its acquaintance, Live Coding is the creation of sonic or visual content generated through the execution of computer code in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The daytime part of the event features workshops hosted by experienced live coders, where newcomers will be guided through the processes in a practical environment, leading to an effective working knowledge of the practice. Experienced users will be able to build on existing skills, branch out into new applications and develop a greater understanding of the craft guided by lightning presentations from experienced performers.&lt;/p&gt;
