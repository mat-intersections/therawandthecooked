                <p>The RAW focusses on Live Coding and code based approaches to the real time creation of sound and image. For those yet to make its acquaintance, Live Coding is the creation of sonic or visual content generated through the execution of computer code in real time.</p>
<p>The daytime part of the event features workshops hosted by experienced live coders, where newcomers will be guided through the processes in a practical environment, leading to an effective working knowledge of the practice. Experienced users will be able to build on existing skills, branch out into new applications and develop a greater understanding of the craft guided by lightning presentations from experienced performers.</p>
<p>The day rounds off with an Algorave, a live coded audio visual spectacular featuring performances from some of the UK's leading lights in audio visual coded performance.</p>

            <h2>0001 - Gerard Roma</h2>
            <p>0001 is a project that explores live coding of low-information signals as an improvisational practice. Binary oscillators are combined and modulated to create complex textures and rhythms.</p>

            <h2>Alo Allik</h2>
            <p>Alo is an Estonian artist who has performed his live coded electronic music and generative computer graphics throughout the world. His aesthetically and geographically restless lifestyle has enabled him to traverse a diverse range of musical worlds including DJ-ing electronic dance music, live electronic jam sessions, electroacoustic composition, free improvisation and audiovisual performances. He has forged collaborations with a number of curious and innovative musicians, writers and visual artists along the way focussed on exploring links between technology, creativity and tradition. In recent years he has been actively participating in the Algorave movement developing a style he describes as noisefunk which combines traditional rhythm patterns with evolutionary synthesis algorithms. Currently, Alo works as a researcher and a lecturer in music technology in London, while continuing to perform his music and visuals to audiences worldwide.</p>

            <p>⎷p38 is a musician and multimedia artist. Their work is concerned with perception, the relationship between the ‘real’ and the ‘virtual’, the ‘digital’ and the ‘acoustic’. Sound is seen as an inextricable aspect of space and ⎷p38 is interested our relationship to new technologies of communication and creation. They involve a personal ethnographic method and have a degree in Anthropology. They have Indian and British heritage, and always consider the eternal vibration of Hindustani sound. They like thinking about multidimensional metaphysical space and the nuances of language. They are currently studying for a MA in Computational Arts.</p>
