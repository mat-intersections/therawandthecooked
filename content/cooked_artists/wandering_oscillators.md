Wandering Oscillators is a one off collaboration by Jon Pigrem (The Third Eye) and James Weaver (Gyratory System and Blick | Trio). Building from a series of improvisations using modular synths and live instruments they will be presenting an downbeat electronic soundscape which blends washes of ambient and appropriated sounds with propulsive rhythms and retro drum machines.
