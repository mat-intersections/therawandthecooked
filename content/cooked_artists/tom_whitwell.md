Tom Whitwell designs DIY musical instruments as Music Thing Modular. He created the enormously popular Turing Machine, Mikrophonie and Radio Music modules for Eurorack Synthesiser, which are open-source designs inspired by early experimental electronic music. He's a former journalist and magazine editor who taught himself electronics after attending a workshop by Tom Bugs on Brick Lane. In his talk, Tom tells the story of how he got started designing his first module, from experimentation and prototyping to design and (distributed) mass production.
