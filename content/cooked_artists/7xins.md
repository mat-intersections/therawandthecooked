Releasing under his 7XINS alias, Ben solely operates as a producer of live electronic music, built on a manipulation of machinery and hardware.

Residing from a post industrial town of South Wales, and with a background in mechanical engineering and electronics, Ben’s transition into audio electronics has been a very natural one, having developed a healthy obsession with machines and the intricacies of sound since his early discovery of hard house and rave culture. 

Now deeply involved in London’s dance music scene with a demanding position on Egg LDN’s team whilst also working on 7XINS productions, a rolling rich analogous sound with a strong sense of depth and atmosphere remains his trademark.
