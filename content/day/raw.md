The RAW focusses on Live Coding and code based approaches to the real time creation of sound and image. For those yet to make its acquaintance, Live Coding is the creationve of sonic or visual content generated through the execution of computer code in real time.

The daytime part of the event features workshops hosted by experienced live coders, where newcomers will be guided through the processes in a practical environment, leading to an effective working knowledge of the practice. Experienced users will be able to build on existing skills, branch out into new applications and develop a greater understanding of the craft guided by lightning presentations from experienced performers.

The day rounds off with an Algorave, a live coded audio visual spectacular featuring performances from some of the UK's leading lights in audio visual coded performance.
