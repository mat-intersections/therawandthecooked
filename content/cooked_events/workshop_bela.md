summary: The [bela](https://bela.io/) team show you how to make an ultra low latency Digital Musial Instrument.

This hands-on workshop introduces [Bela](http://bela.io), an embedded maker platform for responsive audio and sensor processing. Bela can be used to create digital musical instruments, synthesisers, and other interactive projects, which can be developed in C/C++, Pure Data (Pd) or Supercollider, amongst other languages. The platform features an on-board browser-based IDE and oscilloscope for getting started quickly, onboard examples and documentation, and online community resources.

This workshop will focus on creating interactive music projects using Pd. Participants will be guided through some simple circuit-building and Pd programming activities. Bela kits, breadboards, sensors and other electronics will be provided for use during the workshop. Participants should bring their own laptop (any platform) and a pair of headphones.
