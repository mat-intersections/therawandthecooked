summary: [GMSN!](https://gmsn.co.uk/)'s Rob Spencer walks you through building your own modular synth unit.

 GMSN! is an Open Source Synth designer based in Glasgow. PCBs, panels and other accessories are available at [gmsn.co.uk](https://gmsn.co.uk/), with all support related chat at [forum.gmsn.co.uk](https://forum.gmsn.co.uk/). Pure. Open. Modular.

Workshop participants will be taking the raw materials of a PCB and components and cooking up a GMSN! Pure Digit, a small programmable utility Eurorack module. Once the hardware is complete, the software, which includes cool programs such as RandomSequencer, ClockDivider, BasslineGenerator and BitCrusher, will be uploaded to the module. This will be a workshop in SMD Soldering using the hotplate method and all tools and components will be provided.
