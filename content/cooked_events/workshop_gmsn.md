summary: [GMSN!](https://gmsn.co.uk/)'s Rob Spencer walks you through building your own modular synth unit.

Participants will be taking the raw materials of a PCB and components and cooking up a GMSN! Pure Digit, a small programmable utility Eurorack module. Once the hardware is complete, the software, which includes cool programs such as RandomSequencer, ClockDivider, BasslineGenerator and BitCrusher, will be uploaded to the module. This will be a workshop in SMD Soldering using the hotplate method. All tools and components will be provided, however if people have an Arduino knocking around, these can be used to flash the module.

Cost will be £35 per person. I’ve setup a thing on the website, so people can book a place via that, I think this is the easiest way to do it.... https://gmsn.co.uk/product/inter-sections-synth-building-workshop/ GMSN! is an Open Source Synth designer based in Glasgow. PCBs, panels and other accessories are available at gmsn.co.uk, with all support related chat at forum.gmsn.co.uk. Pure. Open. Modular.
