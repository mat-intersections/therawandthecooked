The Yorkshire Programming Ensemble (TYPE) is a collection of humans, Lucy Cheesman, Laurie Johnson, and Ryan Kirkbride, that meet IRL and URL and enjoy exploring rhythmic music in a collaborative virtual space and generally making a lot of noise. We work collaboratively in a shared text buffer using software called Troop and each member of TYPE constructs portions of music-generating code before interacting with the work one another has left behind. By making and unmaking each otherâ€™s code TYPE works both together and against each other in the exploration of sound and rhythms.
