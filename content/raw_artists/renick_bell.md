Tokyo-based Renick Bell improvises bass-heavy algorithmically-generated music full of percussion and noise by live coding with open source software, including software he has written called Conductive. This year he has released albums on Rabit's Halcyon Veil label and Seagrave Records. In 2016 he released an EP on Lee Gamble's UIQ label. His music practice corresponds with a research practice of writing software and writing research papers on live coding, electronic music, and art, as well as teaching in university and other contexts.
