summary: Learn to live code music using [TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/).

[TidalCycles](https://tidalcycles.org/) (or Tidal for short) is a language for live coding patterns. It allows you to make musical patterns with text, describing sequences and ways of transforming and combining them, exploring complex interactions between simple parts.

If you have never live coded before, or are still developing your skills this workshop is for you. You will be guided through your first steps with the platform and shown how to develop on existing abilities by experienced live coders and regular Algrorave performers.
