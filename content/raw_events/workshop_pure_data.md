summary: Learn to live code visuals using [Pure Data](http://puredata.info/).

[Pure Data](http://puredata.info/) is an open source visual programming environment that runs on anything from personal computers to embedded devices and smartphones. It is a major branch of the family of patcher programming languages known as Max, originally developed by Miller Puckette at IRCAM.

If you want to dip your toes into the world of live coded visuals, the GEN library is ideal for you. Learn to generate and manipulate visual material live, guided by experienced live coders and regular Algrorave performers.
